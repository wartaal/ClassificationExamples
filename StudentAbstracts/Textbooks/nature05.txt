For many Swiftcurrent Lake is the hub of points of interest, to be
surpassed by no other spot in the park. From it branch many deep and
interesting glacial valleys. Fishing, boating, swimming, hiking,
photographing, mountain climbing, horseback riding, and nature study
are to be enjoyed at their best here. It is reached by an excellent
spur road from the Blackfeet Highway at Babb, or by trail from Sun
Camp, Granite Park, and Waterton Lakes.

Many Glacier Hotel, the largest hotel in the park, is located on
Swiftcurrent Lake. Just beyond the hotel is an excellent auto camp and
a group of auto housekeeping cabins. The hotel has telegraph and
telephone services, an information desk, curio shop, a grill room and
soda fountain, swimming pool, barber and shoe-shining shop, photograph
shop, a first-aid medical establishment, and other services. A garage
is situated near the hotel. A store with an ample line of campers'
needs, including fresh meat, bread, butter, and eggs, is located in
the auto campground.

Ranger-naturalist service is available at Many Glacier. This includes
daily field walks; a nightly lecture augmented by motion pictures and
slides in the Convention Hall in the basement of the hotel; an evening
campfire entertainment in the auto camp; a cut-flower and geological
exhibit in the hotel lobby and in the auto camp; a small museum on the
opposite shore of the lake from the hotel, on the road leading to the
campground; a self-guiding trail around Swiftcurrent Lake; information
service in the museum; a naturalist-accompanied launch trip on
Swiftcurrent and Josephine Lakes in the afternoon. In addition to this
last-named, several other launch trips are taken daily on these lakes.
This service may be used to shorten hikers' distance to Grinnell Lake
and Glacier.
