Habitat: Although hooded mergansers prefer wooded, clear water streams,
they also use the wooded shorelines of lakes. Drainage of swamps and
river bottoms, removal of snags, and other human activities have been
detrimental to this species as they have been to wood ducks. Hooded
mergansers are more easily disturbed by man and far more sensitive to a
decline in water quality than are wood ducks. Breeding densities often
seem more related to food abundance and availability than to nesting
cavities (Johnsgard 1975).

Nest: Cavities at any height may be selected in any species of tree; the
size and shape of the cavity are apparently not important (Bent 1923).
Natural cavities chosen are similar to those used by wood ducks but with
smaller optimum dimensions. Frequent use of nest boxes has been reported
in Missouri, Mississippi, and Oregon (Bellrose 1976). In Oregon, boxes
were placed 30 to 50 feet apart in sets of 8 (Morse et al. 1969). Some
of the most southerly nesting records of this species are from wood duck
nest boxes (Bellrose 1976).

Food: The food habits of hooded mergansers are not well known, but are
apparently more diversified than those of common mergansers. Of 138
stomachs taken from various locations in the United States, rough fishes
made up 24.5 percent, game fish and unidentified fish fragments 19.4
percent, crayfish 22.3 percent, other crustaceans 10.3 percent, and
aquatic and other insects 13.4 percent (Palmer 1976). Acorns are
sometimes eaten in large quantities. Frogs, tadpoles, and molluscs such
as snails are also consumed.
