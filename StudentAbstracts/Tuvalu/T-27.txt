Does one size fit all? Differences between islands in Tuvalu and ecological perspectives
Stakeholders are individuals, organisations or communities who are responsible for, or affected by, the processes or outcome of the research [1]. Stakeholder engagement (SE) in health research has the potential
to inform quality improvements by incorporating multiple perspectives of the stakeholders beyond the
traditional research team [2]. Increasingly, funders are acknowledging the benefits of SE on research outcomes
and mandating it on grant applications [2]. It can help to improve the health, knowledge and well-being of
communities by decreasing the ambiguity surrounding research findings and increasing early acceptance of the
research findings [3]. Early SE could help obtain funding and facilitate in reducing the gap between research
to policy by creating research that is of benefit and interest to numerous stakeholders [4,5].
