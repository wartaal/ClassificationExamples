Assessment of wind energy potential for Tuvalu with accurate estimation of Weibull parameters
Wind resource assessments are carried out for two sites in Tuvalu: Funafuti and Nukufetau. The wind speeds at 34 and 20 m above ground level were recorded for approximately 12 months and analyzed. The averages of each site are computed as the overall, daily, monthly, annual, and seasonal averages. The overall average wind speeds for Funafuti and Nukufetau at 34 m above ground level were estimated to be 6.19 and 5.36 m/s, respectively. The turbulence intensities at the two sites were also analyzed. The turbulence intensity is also computed for windy and low-wind days. Wind shear analysis was carried out and correlated with temperature variation. Ten different methods: median and quartiles method, the empirical method of Lysen, the empirical method of Justus, the moments method, the least squares method, the maximum likelihood method, the modified maximum likelihood method, the energy pattern factor method, method of multi-objective moments, and the wind atlas analysis and application program method were used to find the Weibull parameters. From these methods, the best method is used to determine the wind power density for the site. The wind power density for Funafuti is 228.18 W/m2 and for Nukufetau is 145.1 W/m2. The site maps were digitized and with the WAsP software, five potential locations were selected for each site from the wind resource map. The annual energy production for the sites was computed using wind atlas analysis and application program to be 2921.34 and 1848.49 MWh. The payback periods of installing the turbines for each site are calculated by performing an economic analysis, which showed payback periods of between 3.13 and 4.21 years for Funafuti and between 4.83 to 6.72 years for Nukufetau.
