A Study on the Coastline Extraction and Coastal Change Analysis Using Sentinel-2 Imagery in Funafuti, Tuvalu
Temporal alterations in coastlines depict the significant changes in coastal areas, driven by both natural processes and human activities. For island nations, monitoring of the coastline is essential due to their vulnerability to such impacts. In this study, Funafuti Atoll, an archipelago of small and scattered islands around the capital of Tuvalu, is selected as the study region, and the aim is to extract coastlines of different islands and investigate coastal area changes between 2019 and 2023 using Sentinel-2 imagery. A simple linear iterative clustering-based superpixel segmentation and adaptive thresholding approach is employed for coastline extraction. Initially, superpixel segmentation is conducted to cluster 3-band image pixels into coherent regions, excluding the sea area. Subsequently, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is calculated, and the superpixels are used to obtain corresponding NDVI regions, on which adaptive Gaussian thresholding is applied to extract coastlines. Finally, the areas enclosed by the extracted coastline boundaries are utilized for change analysis. The results indicate that islands along the western rim of Funafuti exhibited significant alteration (an average decrease of −14.48%), whereas those along the eastern rim remained relatively stable due to the presence of coral rubble ridges and steep slopes. The change analysis revealed that from 2019 to 2020, approximately 15.1 hectares (ha) were eroded, resulting in a net area change rate of −4.14%. Between 2020 and 2021, erosion increased to 20.2 ha, yielding a net change of −7.75%. From 2021 to 2022, 13.2 ha were eroded, corresponding to a −1.74% change. From 2022 to 2023, a net gain of 10.3 ha occurred (+0.25%), primarily due to land reclamation along the lagoon-facing coast of Fongafale Island. Overall, all islands showed a decreasing area trend between 2019 and 2023, with an average net change of −12.97%. The coastal changes occurred along the sand-dominated coast with gentle slopes, possibly driven by the impact of tropical cyclones, prolonged swells, and coastal flooding, which act as the primary driving forces for the study region.
