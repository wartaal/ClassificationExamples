Exploring persons with disabilities preparedness, perceptions and experiences of disasters in Tuvalu
Background Historically, Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) are disproportionately affected by disasters. In Pacific Island Countries (PICs), the risks and vulnerabilities of PwDs arise from social inequalities, as well as environmental barriers. As the frequency and intensity of disasters will increase over the next decade, it is critical that the challenges faced by PwDs are addressed and that they are prepared. Objective This study explores disaster preparedness, perceptions, and experiences with disasters among PwDs in Tuvalu. Methods This qualitative study was carried out among people with physical and sensory disabilities and without post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), who are aged 21 and above. Using grounded theory methodology, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 participants, with 7 then participating in a Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Results A total of 31 PwDs participated, of which 65% were male and 35% female, with a mean age of 44 ±15.70. The results showed how the PwDs ability to prepare, their perceptions, and experiences with disasters have contributed to their resilience to disasters. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of understanding PwDs lived disaster experience to improve their preparedness and resilience for future disasters. This knowledge will assist government and non-government organisations, communities, and families to develop policies and plans that will enhance the preparedness of PwDs for disasters.
