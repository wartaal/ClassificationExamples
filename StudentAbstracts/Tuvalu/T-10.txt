The Risk of Climate-Induced Migration in Tuvalu: Lessons and Way Forward
This article examines the risks posed by climate change to Tuvalu, a Pacific Island nation highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. It explores a series of short-term and long-term risks, such as the potential disappearance of its territory and the resulting displacement of its population, alongside impacts on natural resources, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, and extreme storms. The article discusses measures that the Government of Tuvalu, in collaboration with the international community, has implemented to strengthen community resilience so far. These actions include the use of adaptation technologies to mitigate the impacts of climate hazards, as well as the search for legal and financial solutions to compensate for losses or plan for possible migration in the future. The article concludes by reflecting on the implications for national governance and the international community. Are these interventions effective or, on the contrary, are they perpetuating global inequalities in the fight against climate change?
