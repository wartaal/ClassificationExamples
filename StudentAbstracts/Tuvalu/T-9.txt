Globalisation and policing in Tuvalu: perspectives on negotiating changing power structures
Global influences on policing are not a recent development. The legacy of colonisation is evident in contemporary police organisations and justice systems in the Pacific Islands, which are exposed to globalisation through a range of means. Pacific Island countries are also influenced by traditional sources of authority, such as customary chiefly systems and religious leadership, that shape and contribute to justice and policing in important and nuanced ways. This study aimed to contribute to understanding the dynamic interplay between globalised policing practices and values, and local customary and religious authority from the perspectives of local actors. We draw upon interviews with police officers, community leaders and religious leaders in the small multi-island country of Tuvalu. The findings show that although there are some perceived benefits associated with globalised inter-jurisdictional practices, there can be conflicting approaches and views among local security stakeholders. Overall, the findings suggest that to address issues effectively in the community, police officers must navigate and negotiate with traditional sources of authority–in this case, customary and religious leaders. Despite globalising influences, the dynamic interplay with traditional influences generates nuanced approaches that reflect relationality and plurality in policing. These findings align with scholarly arguments that policing is best understood as co-constituted between the Global North and Global South, shaped by relational processes, and the legacies of colonialism.
