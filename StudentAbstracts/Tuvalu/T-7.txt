International investment law and digital states: the case of Tuvalu
Habitability in Tuvalu is threatened due to coastal flooding and erosion, flooding, and sea level rise (SLR). More than 50% of the Tuvaluan population will likely be exposed to coastal inundation. In response, Tuvalu is preparing for the ultimate form of climate adaptation: the migration of its people as climate refugees and digitalisation of its state into data. This idea was introduced as the Future Now Project, which immediately incited vast intellectual interest. This paper joins in the examination of a Digital Tuvalu from the perspective of international economic law to understand how Tuvalu's international investment law regime may remain intact through this transformation. This study concludes that, by leveraging instruments in sustainable finance in combination with an adaptive approach to international investment law, alongside such practical matters as a physical space to house its population, foreign investment can be positioned to help advance intergenerational development impact for future Tuvaluans.
