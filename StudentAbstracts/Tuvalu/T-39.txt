Student readiness and perception of tablet learning in higher education in the pacific- a case study of Fiji and Tuvalu: Tablet learning at USP
Significant growth and successful integration of mobile devices to the education landscape have garnered the introduction of mobile learning (mLearning) as a new technology-enabled educational tool. Mobile learning has become a new higher educational paradigm which makes learning more flexible and accessible. However, student readiness and their perceptions about educational use of tablet devices are still a concern particularly in the developing countries like the Pacific island countries (PICs). This article investigates these two important attributes of tablet devices in a first year blended course from a higher education institute in the Pacific with a sample of 43 students. The results revealed that the participants perceived that tablet devices were effective and innovative learning tools. The participants supported the idea of using tablet devices and were ready to incorporate them for learning provided there was training in place. This article finally outlines recommendations for the education sectors in the Pacific.
