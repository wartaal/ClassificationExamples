Domestic and bilateral challenges to building relationality in cultural diplomacy: Tuvalu’s performative cultural diplomacy in Taiwan
In this paper, I analyse archival research and semi-structured interviews conducted between 2017 and 2018 in Tuvalu and Taiwan. I outline Tuvalu’s performative cultural diplomacy–performance/dance-based cultural policies used for diplomacy in Taiwan and other international locations–and problems that beset this diplomacy. I first discuss the importance to Tuvalu of the performative/dance form fatele, especially as it relates to domestic diplomacy and cultural representation. I then outline internal and external tensions that arise when Tuvalu adopts domestic performance protocols in its international diplomacy with places like Taiwan. These tensions emerge because, in Taiwan, fatele cannot be presented as it would be in Tuvalu and because the Tuvalu and Taiwan governments contrast sharply in their imaginings of how performative cultural diplomacy should be realised. In the conclusion, I discuss how preoccupation with domestic standards in both Tuvalu and Taiwan hinders the possibility of developing bilateral relationality through performative cultural diplomacy.
