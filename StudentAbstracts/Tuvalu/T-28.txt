Food for thought: Climate change risk and food (in)security in Tuvalu
Climate change presents a considerable threat to food security of low-lying atoll nations in the Pacific including Tuvalu. It is projected to heavily impact agricultural and fishery sectors in Tuvalu, threatening food chains and the ability of Tuvaluans to produce and access safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary and cultural needs. In addition to climate change impacts, food security in Tuvalu is affected by a number of interconnected socio-economic, transboundary and ecosystem factors including access to land, traditional food-acquiring skills, food availability and affordability, cultural practices and the changing way of life. In fact, decline in traditional food-acquiring skills, the lack of interest in local food production practices, and other unfortunate socio-economic circumstances continue adversely affecting food (in)security in Tuvalu. This study assessed the risk of climate change from the perspective of food security domain considering exposure to flood hazard. The results of risk assessment suggested that revival of traditional food-acquiring skills is an important adaptation strategy. Strategies at the community and government levels are proposed to prevent adverse impacts of flooding on and prevent food security in Tuvalu.
