Testate amoebae from two low-lying tropical islets of Tuvalu, South Pacific
Testate amoebae are a polyphyletic group of ubiquitous unicellular eukaryotic micro-organisms. They occur in high abundances in freshwater and terrestrial habitats, where they play an important role in biogeochemical and ecological processes. Terrestrial amoeba data from small tropical islands are rarely available despite the fact that they are interesting for investigations on global change induced sea level rise, biodiversity and biogeography. Based on a previously published paper on the impact of increased salinity to testate amoebae, the aim of this study is to present data on amoebal biodiversity from two remote, low-lying tropical islets of Tuvalu (South Pacific). In total 47 species and subspecific taxa of testate amoebae were recorded. These findings are based on 21 soil samples from 7 terrestrial habitats examined microscopically. Most species found were relatively small (< 100 μm) and considered as cosmopolitan. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (NMDS) separated the samples by habitat structure and flooding regime rather than islet origin. Despite the apparently remote character of the study sites, human influence on distribution and biogeography of testate amoebae cannot be excluded.
