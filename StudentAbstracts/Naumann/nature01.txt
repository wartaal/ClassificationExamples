IT is called All-heal, Hercules’s All-heal, and Hercules’s Woundwort,
because it is supposed that Hercules learned the herb and its virtues
from Chiron, when he learned physic of him. Some call it Panay, and
others Opopane-wort.

_Descript._] Its root is long, thick, and exceeding full of juice, of
a hot and biting taste, the leaves are great and large, and winged
almost like ash-tree leaves, but that they are something hairy, each
leaf consisting of five or six pair of such wings set one against the
other upon foot-stalks, broad below, but narrow towards the end; one
of the leaves is a little deeper at the bottom than the other, of a
fair yellowish fresh green colour: they are of a bitterish taste,
being chewed in the mouth; from among these rises up a stalk, green in
colour, round in form, great and strong in magnitude, five or six feet
in altitude, with many joints, and some leaves thereat; towards the top
come forth umbels of small yellow flowers, after which are passed away,
you may find whitish, yellow, short, flat seeds, bitter also in taste.

_Place._] Having given you a description of the herb from bottom to
top, give me leave to tell you, that there are other herbs called by
this name; but because they are strangers in England, I give only the
description of this, which is easily to be had in the gardens of divers
places.

_Time._] Although Gerrard saith, that they flower from the beginning
of May to the end of December, experience teaches them that keep it in
their gardens, that it flowers not till the latter end of the summer,
and sheds its seeds presently after.

_Government and virtues._] It is under the dominion of Mars, hot,
biting, and choleric; and remedies what evils Mars inflicts the body
of man with, by sympathy, as vipers’ flesh attracts poison, and
the loadstone iron. It kills the worms, helps the gout, cramp, and
convulsions, provokes urine, and helps all joint-aches. It helps all
cold griefs of the head, the vertigo, falling-sickness, the lethargy,
the wind cholic, obstructions of the liver and spleen, stone in the
kidneys and bladder. It provokes the terms, expels the dead birth:
it is excellent good for the griefs of the sinews, itch, stone, and
tooth-ache, the biting of mad dogs and venomous beasts, and purges
choler very gently.
