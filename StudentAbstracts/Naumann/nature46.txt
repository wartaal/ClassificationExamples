The Brook Trout--The New York Charr--Salmo fontinalis.--Salmon
tribe; ventrals in abdomen, rays soft.

The shoulder and first back fins have each eleven rays; the second back
fin is mere fatty matter and rayless, the characteristic of the salmon
tribe; the ventral has eight, the anal fifteen, and the tail nineteen
rays. The back is dusky green, mottled with yellow spots; growing
lighter on the sides, where the spots have irregularly a beautiful blue
or carmine speck in the centre; the belly is silver white, with a
roseate tinge as it fades into the darker colors of the sides; the
shoulder fins are yellowish at the base, the ventrals yellowish red, the
anal reddish, and in all the rays are dusky. The gill-covers have no
defined spots.

The body is covered with delicate scales that will escape all but the
strictest observation. The teeth are on the tongue and throat, but none
on the roof of the mouth discernible to the naked eye; there is an outer
row on the lower jaw, and an inner and outer row on the upper jaw. This
fish is so well known to the public from its extensive distribution
through the northern States, and so totally dissimilar from the Perch
and Bass, miscalled Trout at the South, that a more particular
description does not seem necessary.

Another fish taken at the North in the smaller lakes is called Red
Trout, and attains the weight of twenty-five pounds. It is rare, and
would appear to be an undescribed species, differing from the trout of
the brooks and lakes, and not generally known even to sportsmen. A fish
of a somewhat similar character was on exhibition at an eating-house in
this city, but appeared to have been scaled. It was three feet six
inches long, and weighed eighteen pounds. The back was very dark, the
sides being of a lighter neutral tint, without any spots. There were a
number of vomerine teeth, and the fin-rays, as far as could be
ascertained by a cursory examination, were--
