[Enter PARKER.]

PARKER.  Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?

LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes—who has called?

PARKER.  Lord Darlington, my lady.

LADY WINDERMERE.  [Hesitates for a moment.]  Show him up—and I’m at
home to any one who calls.

PARKER.  Yes, my lady.

[Exit C.]

LADY WINDERMERE.  It’s best for me to see him before to-night.  I’m glad
he’s come.

[Enter PARKER C.]

PARKER.  Lord Darlington,

[Enter LORD DARLINGTON C.]

[Exit PARKER.]

LORD DARLINGTON.  How do you do, Lady Windermere?

LADY WINDERMERE.  How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.

LORD DARLINGTON.  They are quite perfect.  [Sees a fan lying on the
table.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?

LADY WINDERMERE.  Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?

LORD DARLINGTON.  No?  Is it really?

LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
down.  [Still arranging flowers.]

LORD DARLINGTON.  [Sitting down.]  I wish I had known it was your
birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
you.

[A short pause.]

LADY WINDERMERE.  Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.

LORD DARLINGTON.  I, Lady Windermere?

[Enter PARKER and FOOTMAN C., with tray and tea things.]

LADY WINDERMERE.  Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [Wipes her hands
with her pocket-handkerchief, goes to tea-table, and sits down.]
Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?

  [Exit PARKER C.]

LORD DARLINGTON.  [Takes chair and goes across L.C.]  I am quite
miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [Sits down at
table L.]

LADY WINDERMERE.  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
whole evening.

LORD DARLINGTON.  [Smiling.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
that the only pleasant things to pay are compliments.  They’re the only
things we can pay.

LADY WINDERMERE.  [Shaking her head.]  No, I am talking very seriously.
You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.

LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, but I did mean them.  [Takes tea which she offers
him.]

LADY WINDERMERE.  [Gravely.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
think you pretend to be worse.

LORD DARLINGTON.  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.

LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you make that your special one?  [Still seated
at table L.]

LORD DARLINGTON.  [Still seated L.C.]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited
people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
astounding stupidity of optimism.

LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t you want the world to take you seriously then,
Lord Darlington?

LORD DARLINGTON.  No, not the world.  Who are the people the world takes
seriously?  All the dull people one can think of, from the Bishops down
to the bores.  I should like you to take me very seriously, Lady
Windermere, you more than any one else in life.

LADY WINDERMERE.  Why—why me?

LORD DARLINGTON.  [After a slight hesitation.]  Because I think we
might be great friends.  Let us be great friends.  You may want a friend
some day.

LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you say that?

LORD DARLINGTON.  Oh!—we all want friends at times.

LADY WINDERMERE.  I think we’re very good friends already, Lord
Darlington.  We can always remain so as long as you don’t—

LORD DARLINGTON.  Don’t what?

LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t spoil it by saying extravagant silly things to
me.  You think I am a Puritan, I suppose?  Well, I have something of the
Puritan in me.  I was brought up like that.  I am glad of it.  My mother
died when I was a mere child.  I lived always with Lady Julia, my
father’s elder sister, you know.  She was stern to me, but she taught me
what the world is forgetting, the difference that there is between what
is right and what is wrong.  She allowed of no compromise.  I allow
of none.

LORD DARLINGTON.  My dear Lady Windermere!

LADY WINDERMERE.  [Leaning back on the sofa.]  You look on me as being
behind the age.—Well, I am!  I should be sorry to be on the same level as
an age like this.

LORD DARLINGTON.  You think the age very bad?

LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  Nowadays people seem to look on life as a
speculation.  It is not a speculation.  It is a sacrament.  Its ideal is
Love.  Its purification is sacrifice.

LORD DARLINGTON.  [Smiling.]  Oh, anything is better than being
sacrificed!

LADY WINDERMERE.  [Leaning forward.]  Don’t say that.

LORD DARLINGTON.  I do say it.  I feel it—I know it.
