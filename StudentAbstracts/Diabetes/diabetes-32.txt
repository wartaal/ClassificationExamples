Is a Simple Food-Diverting Operation the Solution for Type 2 Diabetes Treatment? Experimental Study in a Non-Obese Rat Model
Background: The feasibility of a side-to-side jejunoileal anastomosis (SJA) to control type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was studied in non-obese diabetic Goto–Kakizaki (GK) rats. Methods: Seventeen 14-week-old male GK rats were divided into three groups: SJA bypassing 60 % of the small bowel length, sham-operated jejunoileal bypass (Sham group), and control animals. Rats were observed for 10 weeks after surgery. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were measured before and after the procedure. Results: Animals with SJA exhibited normalization of FBG levels from the 1st and up to the 10th postoperative week when the experiment terminated. OGTT compared with sham-operated and control groups was also significantly better at 3 and 8 weeks postoperatively. Conclusions: A simple SJA, diverting the food and biliopancreatic secretion to the distal small bowel, was able to normalize both FBG levels and OGTT in a non-obese diabetic rat model.
