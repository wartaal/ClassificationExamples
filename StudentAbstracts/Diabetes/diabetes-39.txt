Type 2 diabetes treatment: Exenatide as an alternative, or in association with insulin therapy?
Currently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are classified in two groups according to their half-live: short half-live, some hours (exenatide [EXE], lixisenatide), or long half-live, some days or weeks (liraglutide, exenatide-LAR, albiglutide, dulaglutide, etc.). In France, currently EXE is the sole marketed GLP-1R agonist with a therapeutic indication permitting its use in association with basal insulin in type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. This review presents the main results and data from randomized clinical studies and clinical practice surveys on EXE use in two common clinical situations: add-on to oral antidiabetics (OADs) as an alternative to basal insulin in T2D patients not achieving glycemic goal with these OADs; add-on to basal insulin (± OADs) as an alternative to prandial insulin addition in T2D patients not achieving glycemic goal with basal insulin (± OADs). In these two clinical situations, EXE addition represents a credible choice, permitting to physicians to elaborate a therapeutic strategy individually adapted to the T2D patient. In this article, advantages and limitations of such a strategy are discussed.
