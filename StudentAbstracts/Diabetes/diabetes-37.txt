Type 2 diabetes treatment: Exenatide prolonged release
The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, a therapeutic class approved by Health Authorities for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), include several molecules. All of them have to be injected subcutaneously however they differ structurally and pharmacologically. Currently they are arbitrary classified within two groups based on their half-life: short half-life, some hours (exenatide, lixisenatide), and longer half-life, one day to one week (liraglutide, exenatide prolonged-release). This review presents exenatide prolonged-release (Bydureon®) main pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics properties and results from randomized clinical trials, a GLP-1R agonist approved for T2D treatment and marketed in the US and approved in Europe where it is available in some countries and expected to be available in France.
