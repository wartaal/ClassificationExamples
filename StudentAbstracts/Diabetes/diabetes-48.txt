Comprehensive review of type 2 diabetes treatment in primary health care. Hygienic, dietetic, educational and pharmacological aspects
Type 2 diabetes is a highly prevalent disease and its management is performed mainly in primary health care. In the present article, focused on the nursing point of view, we propose a comprehensive and very simple approach to the treatment of patients with diabetes, based on the authors' broad clinical experience. There are 5 pillars of type 2 diabetes treatment: diet, exercise, blood glucose autoanalysis, drugs, and control of vascular risk factors (an important question that is not dealt with in this article). A diabetic diet is always required at all phases of the disease. Regular, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has demonstrated benefits in the treatment of diabetes. Blood glucose autoanalysis is recommended in certain subgroups of patients. Throughout the natural history of type 2 diabetes, drug therapy is structured in stages, which are analyzed in depth in the present article.
