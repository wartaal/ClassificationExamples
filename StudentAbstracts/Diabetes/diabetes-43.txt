Tragic consequences of the economical cost of diabetes treatment in sub-saharan countries (apart from the cost of complications): The Ivory Coast' example Graves
Incidence of diabetes is increasing dramatically in developing countries, including sub-Saharan Africa. In these countries, where most inhabitants have very low income, and no - or extremely limited - health insurance coverage, diabetes treatment, either type 1 or type 2, is highly expensive, particularly with regard to patients and their families income. In Ivory Coast, our estimations are that treatment costs represent 70 to 96% of the family income for the poorest patients and 25 to 55% for patients with middle resources; most (66 to 75%) patients don't have health insurance coverage. Moreover, this amount of expenses doesn't take into account indirect costs, nor those of complications and hospitalizations due to diabetes. Diabetes is now a major health and economic challenge in developing countries, but it doesn't receive as much consideration and financial support as other serious, communicable diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria.
