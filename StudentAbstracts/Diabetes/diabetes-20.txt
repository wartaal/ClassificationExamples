Identification of people with diabetes treatment through lipids profile using machine learning algorithms
Diabetes incidence has been a problem, because according with the World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation, the number of people with this disease is increasing very fast all over the world. Diabetic treatment is important to prevent the development of several complications, also lipid profile monitoring is important. For that reason the aim of this work is the implementation of machine learning algorithms that are able to classify cases, that corresponds to patients diagnosed with diabetes that have diabetes treatment, and controls that refers to subjects who do not have diabetes treatment but some of them have diabetes, bases on lipids profile levels. Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision trees and random forest were implemented, all of them were evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC-ROC curve metrics. Artificial neural network obtain an acurracy of 0.685 and an AUC value of 0.750, logistic regression achieve an accuracy of 0.729 and an AUC value of 0.795, K-nearest neighbor gets an accuracy of 0.669 and an AUC value of 0.709, on the other hand, decision tree reached an accuracy pg 0.691 and a AUC value of 0.683, finally random forest achieve an accuracy of 0.704 and an AUC curve of 0.776. The performance of all models was statistically significant, but the best performance model for this problem corresponds to logistic regression.
