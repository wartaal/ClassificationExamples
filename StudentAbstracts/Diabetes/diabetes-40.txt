Therapeutic inertia in Type 2 diabetes Treatment
Therapeutic inertia, ie. failure to uptitrate medications when a disease is uncontrolled, can be encountered in any chronic disease. Concerning Type 2 diabetes, therapeutic inertia can be applied as well to antidiabetic treatment as to treatment of each of the cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidaemia). We will illustrate therapeutic inertia in Type 2 diabetes through 2 French-specific studies and 1 European study having included France, in order to demonstrate it is useless to stigmatize prescriptors who would be considered as « poor pupils » when not strictly applying the expert type 2 diabetes guidelines, and to suggest it is quite more interesting and useful to understand the reasons why the therapeutic choice by the duo physicianpatient can sometimes differ from guidelines. Such a vision does not preclude to elaborate and spread expert guidelines as it is useful and stimulating to have benchmarks to be able to assess temporal trends of the quality of care delivered to type 2 diabetic patients, but it leads to put therapeutic inertia into perspective for clinical practice. Indeed, by regards to the ACCORD trial data, it appears mandatory to invidualize glycaemic targets, thus to choose the most appropriate antidiabetic treatment for each patient.
