A Real-World Prospective Study of the Effectiveness and Safety of Automated Insulin Delivery Compared With Other Modalities of Type 1 Diabetes Treatment During Ramadan Intermittent Fasting
OBJECTIVE To compare the fasting experience and glycemic control during Ramadan among people with type 1 diabetes (PWT1D) who use automated insulin delivery (AID) versus other modalities of treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 294 PWT1D who attempted fasting during Ramadan in 2022 were categorized on the basis of treatment modality into one of five groups: 1) AID (n = 62); 2) conventional pump + continuous glucose monitoring (CGM; n = 37); 3) pump + selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG; n = 8); 4) multiple daily injections (MDI) + CGM (n = 155); and 5) MDI + SMBG (n = 32). Predictors of fasting most days of Ramadan (i.e., breaking fast ≤2 days because of diabetes) were analyzed using uni-and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS The median numbers of days when fasting was broken because of diabetes were 2, 5, 3, 3.5, and 2.5 for AID, conventional pump + CGM, MDI + CGM, pump + SMBG, and MDI + SMBG users, respectively (P = 0.047). Users of AID had a significantly greater time in range (TIR) and lower glycemia risk index, time below range, and time above range compared with users of conventional pumps and MDI (both P < 0.05). Likewise, 53% of AID users attained the double target of 1) breaking fast ≤2 days because of diabetes and 2) maintaining TIR ≥70% during Ramadan compared with only 3% of the conventional pump users and 44% of the MDI + CGM users (both P < 0.05). Compared with MDI + CGM users, AID users were twice as likely to complete fasting most days of Ramadan. CONCLUSIONS Use of AID is associated with the highest rates of fasting and best glycemic control during Ramadan fasting.
