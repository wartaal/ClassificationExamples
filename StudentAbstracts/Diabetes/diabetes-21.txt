Efficacy of modern diabetes treatments dpp-4i, sglt-2i, and glp-1ra in white and asian patients with diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. diabetes care 2020; 43: 1948–1957
We read the article by Gan et al. (1) with great interest and appreciate their exemplary work. The authors have concluded that among the newer antidiabetes drugs of 24 weeks’ duration, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) lower HbA1c better in studies predominantly of Asian ethnicity (∆ −0.32%, P = 0.0003) compared with White ethnicities, but dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) do not. Moreover, this meta-analysis also finds that both SGLT-2i (∆ −0.28%, P = 0.02) and DPP-4i (∆ −0.24%, P = 0.01) lower HbA1c further in studies predominantly of Asians ethnicities at 12 weeks but the GLP-RA do not, when compared with White participants. These findings would likely encourage clinicians to use more SGLT-2i and perhaps less GLP-1RA for patients of Asian ethnicity, in addition to other inherent reasons such as oral versus injectable route and the cost. The authors also claim that this is the first meta-analysis that studied the ethnic differences in glycemic response with SGLT-2i.
