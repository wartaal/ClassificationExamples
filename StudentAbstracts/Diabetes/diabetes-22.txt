Efficacy of modern diabetes treatments DPP-4i, sglt-2i, and GLP-1ra in white and asian patients with diabetes: A systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled Trials
BACKGROUND The pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes differs markedly by ethnicity. PURPOSE A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of ethnicity on the glucose-lowering efficacy of the newer oral agents, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i), glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), using evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES A literature search was conducted in PubMed of all randomized, placebo-controlled trials of DPP-4i, SGLT-2i, and GLP-1RA. The search strategy was developed based on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords. STUDY SELECTION A total of 64 studies that qualified for meta-analysis after full-text review based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteriadRCTs with at least 50 patients in each arm, >70% of population from Asian or white group, duration ‡24 weeks, and publication up to March 2019dwere selected for systematic review and metaanalysis. DATA EXTRACTION Data extraction was done for aggregated study-level data by two independent researchers. Absolute changes in HbA<inf>1c</inf> (%) from baseline to 24 weeks between the drug and placebo were considered as the primary end point of the study. DATA SYNTHESIS Change in HbA<inf>1c</inf> was evaluated by computing mean differences and 95% CIs between treatment and placebo arms. LIMITATIONS The study is based on summarized data and could not be separated based on East Asians and South Asians. CONCLUSIONS The glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT-2i, and to a lesser extent DPP-4i, was greater instudies of predominantly Asian ethnicity compared withstudies ofpredominantly white ethnicity. There was no difference seen by ethnicity for GLP-1RA.
