Use of medicinal plants for type 2 diabetes treatment, in Morocco
Diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial chronic disease with a dramatic worldwide increase. To control hyperglycemia, several traditional remedies were tried and among them medicinal plants retain a large place. This prospective study objective was to evaluate their place and the various aspects of their use in diabetic patients living in south Morocco.356 type 2 diabetic patients (221 women, 135 men) were questioned through a questionnaire focusing on medicinal plant used, modalities and reasons for their use.185 (52%) patients declared using medicinal plant to control glycemia. Their use is significantly more frequent in women and in > 50-year old diabetics and those with a low educational level. Use of 38 plants was recorded, mainly Trigonella foenum, Artemisia abrotanum, Euphorbia resinifera, Salvia officinalis and Nigella sativa. Patients advocated several reasons to justify their use, but mainly a previous positive experience claimed by other diabetics. Most users are unaware of plant's toxicity as well as of their appropriate use (part to be used, mode to prepare them and quantity).Additional validated scientific data are clearly needed to improve knowledge on the mechanism of action and optimal use of medicinal plants before to be able to implement their use within the type 2 diabetes therapeutic armentarium. A particular attention has to be paid to sensibilize the general population as well as diabetic patients on the risks tied to an anarchical use of traditional/medicinal plants, particularly those with a known toxicity potential.
