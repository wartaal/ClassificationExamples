Assessment of the Knowledge of Healthcare Professionals on Nutrition and Diabetes Self-management in Type-2 Diabetes Treatment at a Health Facility in Tshwane, South Africa
Background: Diabetes mellitus remains an important non-communicable disease globally and is rapidly emerging as a major public health problem. The burden of the disease continues to rise, even in sub-Saharan Africa. Healthcare professionals often lack the necessary skills to lead patients through lifestyle modifications and instead depend on pharmacological therapy. Recent studies advocate for the integration of innovative healthcare approaches and the promotion of non-pharmacological treatment in the context of broader education on lifestyle modifications for the management of diabetes and other conditions. Aim and Objectives: This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge of nurses on nutrition and diabetes self-management in treating patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at a community health centre in the Tshwane district. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 53 nurses. A standardized questionnaire was modified to collect data from the nurses working at the health facility. Results: Most healthcare professionals with lower knowledge scores were not aware of the DM guideline, with a p-value < 0.05. The healthcare professionals with a high knowledge score were not aware of the DM guideline as well. Overall, healthcare professionals working at the CHC had lower knowledge scores on nutrition and self-management of diabetes. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals showed a notable gap in knowledge pertaining to nutrition and the self-management of diabetes. Promoting the adoption of current diabetes management guidelines and encouraging continued professional development can effectively address knowledge disparities, particularly among professionals with limited experience and diploma-level credentials.
