New type 2 diabetes treatments and diabetic retinopathy
Although the increase in retinal events observed with semaglutide (a GLP1 receptor agonist [GLP1-RA]) in the SUSTAIN-6 randomized trial raised doubts about its ocular safety, most subsequent studies have been reassuring. Above all, they emphasized the major role of the rapid and profound drop in blood glucose in the mechanism of an early worsening of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a phenomenon described 40 years ago following therapeutic intensification in patients with type 1 diabetes. Thus, caution is required when initiating new therapies, especially GLP1-RA with its high glucose lowering capacity, particularly in patients with a long history of uncontrolled diabetes and DR. Their prescription should be accompanied by a prior ophthalmologic examination, follow-up, and treatment if necessary.
