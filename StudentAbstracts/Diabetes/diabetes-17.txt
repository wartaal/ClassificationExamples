Projecting the Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes–Related End-Stage Kidney Disease Until 2040: A Comparison Between the Effects of Diabetes Prevention and the Effects of Diabetes Treatment
OBJECTIVE This study sought to examine the effects of two diabetes prevention approaches and of widespread use of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) among people with diabetes on the future incidence of diabetes-related end-stage kidney disease (ESKD-D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We developed a life table model to project the incidence of ESKD-D for type 2 diabetes in Australia until 2040. We projected incident ESKD-D under three separate scenarios: a large-scale lifestyle modification program for diabetes prevention; a population-wide sugar-sweetened beverage tax for diabetes prevention; and widespread use of SGLT2is among people with diabetes. RESULTS Assuming current trends, we projected that the annual incidence of ESKD-D will increase from 3.7 per 100,000 of the general population in 2014 to 5.7 by 2040. Incorporating the diabetes prevention approaches, we projected that the annual incidence of ESKD-D will be between 5.2 and 5.5 per 100,000 by 2040. When we modeled scenarios in which 50% and 70% of eligible people with diabetes were prescribed an SGLT2i, the annual incidence of ESKD-D by 2040 was projected to be 4.7 and 4.3 per 100,000, respectively. SGLT2is were projected to reduce the total number of incident ESKD-D cases between 2020 and 2040 by 12–21% compared with current trends, whereas diabetes prevention reduced cases by 1–3%. CONCLUSIONS It is likely that the number of people developing ESKD-D will increase over the coming decades, although widespread SGLT2i use will be effective at limiting this increase. Diabetes prevention will be crucial to prevent an ever-increasing burden of diabetes complications.
