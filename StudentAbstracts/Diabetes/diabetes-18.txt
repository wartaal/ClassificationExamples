Diabetes treatment before the insulin era
Before the availability of insulin the life expectancy of people with diabetes mellitus was very poor because there were only bizarre pharmacological treatments such as opium. During the 19th century, physical activity and dietary interventions significantly improved the overall prognosis for diabetes in adults. Dietary recommendations were based on opposing convictions: some considered that restrictions were necessary while others recommended overeating with sugary products to compensate for urinary loss of glucose. During the decade before the discovery of insulin, Allen and Joslin endorsed fasting and caloric restricted diets resulting in some improvement of glycosuria, acidosis, delayed death among children and adolescents … and often severe undernutrition.
