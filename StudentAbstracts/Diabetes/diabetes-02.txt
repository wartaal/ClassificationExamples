Icodec ONWARDS: A review of the first once-weekly diabetes treatment for nurse practitioners and physician assistants
Background:Diabetes management is challenged by the complexity of treatment regimens and the need for frequent injections, affecting patient adherence and quality of life. Insulin icodec, a once-weekly basal insulin analog, represents a significant innovation, potentially simplifying diabetes care and improving outcomes.Objectives:This review aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and clinical implications of insulin icodec for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its potential to affect current treatment paradigms.Data Sources:A review was conducted comparing once-weekly insulin icodec with daily basal insulin analogs using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines to ensure transparent reporting of systematic reviews. A search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov, focusing on efficacy and safety outcomes.Conclusions:Insulin icodec has demonstrated effective glycemic management and a safety profile comparable to daily basal insulins. Its extended half-life and steady-state glucose-lowering effect have the potential to reduce the burden of daily injections and improve patient adherence.Implications for Practice:The introduction of once-weekly insulin icodec represents an advancement in diabetes care. For front-line clinicians, this innovation aligns with the need for more straightforward medication regimens. Coupled with continuous glucose monitoring systems, it enables a more personalized and efficient approach to diabetes management, with the potential to improve patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. This underscores the impact of integrating such advancements into practice, highlighting the role of nurse practitioners and physician assistants in adopting these innovations to optimize patient care.
