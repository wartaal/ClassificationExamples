Type 2 diabetes treatment. Where are we by acting on glucagon?
Despite numerous studies dating back more than 60 years, showing the key role of glucagon in the pathophysiology of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, therapeutic approaches aiming at reducing its effects are still in the making. The new molecules intended at inhibiting the actions of glucagon, glucagon receptor antagonists (Glucagon-RA), have been the subject of recent trials in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is especially the compound LY2409021 which, for the first time, showed a potential of realistic use. This confirms Roger Unger's visionary and persistent five-decade-long hypothesis of a therapeutic approach based on the role of excess glucagon rather than insulin deficiency. Offering the opportunity to expand, perhaps, our pharmacopoeia. However, recently published security data raises doubts about their near market reach.
