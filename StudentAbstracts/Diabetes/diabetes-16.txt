Trends in Timing of and Glycemia at Initiation of Second-line Type 2 Diabetes Treatment in U.S. Adults
OBJECTIVE Therapeutic inertia threatens the potential long-term benefits of achieving early glycemic control after type 2 diabetes diagnosis. We evaluated temporal trends in second-line diabetes medication initiation among individuals initially treated with metformin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We included data from 199,042 adults with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs health care system initially treated with metformin monotherapy from 2005 to 2013. We used multivariable Cox proportional haz-ards and linear regression to estimate associations of year of metformin mono-therapy initiation with time to second-line diabetes treatment over 5 years of follow-up (primary outcome) and with hemoglobin A<inf>1c</inf> (HbA<inf>1c</inf>) at the time of sec-ond-line diabetes treatment initiation (secondary outcome). RESULTS The cumulative 5-year incidence of second-line medication initiation declined from 47% among metformin initiators in 2005 to 36% in 2013 counterparts (P < 0.0001) despite a gradual increase in mean HbA<inf>1c</inf> at the end of follow-up (from 6.94 ± 1.28% to 7.09 ± 1.42%, P<inf>trend</inf> < 0.0001). In comparisons with metformin monotherapy initiators in 2005, adjusted hazard ratios for 5-year initiation of sec-ond-line diabetes treatment ranged from 0.90 (95% CI 0.87, 0.92) for 2006 met-formin initiators to 0.68 (0.66, 0.70) for 2013 counterparts. Among those receiving second-line treatment within 5 years of metformin initiation, HbA<inf>1c</inf> at second-line medication initiation increased from 7.74 ± 1.66% in 2005 metformin initiators to 8.55 ± 1.92% in 2013 counterparts (P<inf>trend</inf> < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS We observed progressive delays in diabetes treatment intensification consistent with therapeutic inertia. Process-of-care interventions early in the diabetes disease course may be needed to reverse adverse temporal trends in diabetes care.
