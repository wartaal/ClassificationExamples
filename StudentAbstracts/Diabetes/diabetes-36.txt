Saul Genuth, MD: clinical researcher and leader in developing modern diabetes Treatment
Saul Genuth was born to David L. and Anna Einhorn Genuth on 13 March 1931 in Norwalk, Connecticut. His father was an orthodox rabbi and his mother was a housewife. David Genuth was born and raised in Hungary but immigrated to the U.S. to escape induction into the Romanian army (the area of Hungary where he lived ceded to Romania after World War I). Anna’s parents came from Poland, seeking a better life for their future family. David became an orthodox rabbi, while Anna remained a homemaker and a rabbi’s wife (which Saul states was a profession in and of itself).
