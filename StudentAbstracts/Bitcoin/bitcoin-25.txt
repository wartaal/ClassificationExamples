Enhancing Bitcoin Price Prediction with Deep Learning: Integrating Social Media Sentiment and Historical Data
Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, is renowned for its extreme volatility and speculative nature, making accurate price prediction a persistent challenge for investors. While recent studies have employed multivariate models to integrate historical price data with social media sentiment analysis, this study focuses on improving an existing univariate approach By incorporating sentiment and tweet volume data into a multivariate framework, we systematically evaluated the benefits of this integration. Among the five LSTM-based models developed for this study, the Multi-LSTM-Sentiment model achieved the best performance, with the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.00196 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.00304. These results underscore the significance of including social media sentiment in predictive modelling and demonstrate its potential to enhance decision-making in the highly dynamic cryptocurrency market.
