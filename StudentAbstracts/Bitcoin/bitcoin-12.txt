Deep Learning and Machine Learning Insights Into the Global Economic Drivers of the Bitcoin Price
This study examines the connection between Bitcoin and global factors, including the VIX, the oil price, the US dollar index, the gold price, and interest rates estimated using the Federal funds rate and treasury securities rate, for forecasting analysis. Deep learning methodologies, including LSTM, GRU, CNN, and TFT, with machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVR, were employed to identify the optimal prediction model for the Bitcoin price. The findings indicate that the TFT model is the most successful predictive approach, with the gold price identified as the most relevant component in determining the Bitcoin price. After the gold indicator, the US dollar index was a substantial factor in the explanation of the Bitcoin price. The TFT model also included regulatory decisions and global events. It was estimated that the Bitcoin price was significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. After that, global climate events and China mining ban strongly affected the Bitcoin price. These findings indicate that regulatory decisions and global events determine the Bitcoin price in addition to macroeconomic factors. The VAR analysis was employed as a robustness check. The results indicate that gold and oil prices have a strong negative influence on Bitcoin, particularly in the long term. The paper has significant policy implications for investors, portfolio managers, and scholars.
