Crypto Trading and Bitcoin Prices: Evidence from a New Database of Retail Adoption
Prices for cryptocurrencies have undergone multiple boom-bust cycles, together with ongoing entry by retail investors. To investigate the drivers of crypto adoption, we assemble a novel publicly available database on retail use of crypto exchange apps at daily frequency for 95 countries over 2015–2022. We show that a rising Bitcoin price is followed by entry of new users, in particular among more risk-seeking segments of the population. Moreover, we find that when prices rise larger holders sell, likely making a return at retail users’ expense. We confirm these findings by exploiting an exogenous decline in the Bitcoin price during the social unrest in Kazakhstan in early 2022.
