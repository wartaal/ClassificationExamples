Impact of oil and gold prices on Bitcoin price during Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Gaza wars
Political tensions between countries and geopolitical events can create significant uncertainty in financial markets, impacting the prices of traditional assets such as oil and gold, as well as the emerging asset, Bitcoin. This study investigates the effect of gold and oil prices, including their price shocks, on Bitcoin price during two specific conflicts: the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Gaza conflict. To achieve this, we employed the Vector Auto-Regression (VAR) method and wavelet coherence analysis. The data used spans daily observations from January 2022 to April 2024.The findings indicate that gold prices have a positive impact on Bitcoin prices. Specifically, there is a predominantly short-term relationship between gold prices and Bitcoin prices throughout the entire period under review, with this influence gradually decreasing over the medium and long term. Conversely, the relationship between Brent oil prices and Bitcoin prices during the same period shows that crude oil prices generally have a negative and insignificant effect on Bitcoin prices in the short term.
